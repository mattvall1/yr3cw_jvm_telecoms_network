## Introduction
EuroConnect Telecommunications, a telecommunications provider, plans to expand its high-speed fiber-optic
network across all European capital cities. To optimize costs and ensure efficient connectivity, EuroConnect
aims to establish the network using a minimum spanning tree (MST) that will connect all capital cities with the
minimum total cable length.

The project requires the design and implementation of an MST that links all European capitals, ensuring
reliable and cost-effective communication infrastructure across the continent.
